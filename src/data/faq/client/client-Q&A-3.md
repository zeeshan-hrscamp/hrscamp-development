question: "Why do businesses contract out HR?"
answer: "One of the numerous advantages of outsourcing is having a team of HR specialists available to help you with any HR-related issues. The right policies and processes in place will assure compliance with employment law, and you will greatly lower your chance of being sued in an employment tribunal by heeding our advice when an employment situation arises. The time your team spends on administrative work will be reduced by outsourcing your HR to a group of professionals, giving up more focus on revenue-generating activities."
